        <p> My name is Steve. I'm 65 years old. Like long walks on the beach and watching the sunset over the pacific ocean. My past valiant acheivements I have played squash for my country. Competing at the Bejing Olympics.I'm very smart and curious about everything. However, I don't like too much noise and chaos and prefer to be alone in a quiet place. Usually I sit upstairs in a small room/ a chair and a TV and just relax and think after school as a sort of "unwinding" time. I'm funny, and I make cracks and jokes about everything, but sometimes I go too far, and I don't really notice it. I can't read people's cues and unspoken rules and whatnot, so "social norms" and "unspoken rules" and things like that are beyond me. I say what I feel about myself, a person, an event, anything and I say it out loud and proud. I don't care if people get offended by my blunt truth, because I believe that people are too sheltered from reality these days. I am constantly criticizing myself, and since I love to write and draw, I'm always editing things, always trying to achieve perfection in everything I do. This makes me a perfectionist and a procrastinator, and if I am assigned a project that says "do anything you want" I'm frozen. I need it to be narrowed down, I can't just go off and do ANYTHING. Give me some limitations, please. 

 Also, I'm cold at times, aloof, but that's only because I'm not really in touch with other people's feelings. Having ADHD, I'm also random, bringing up things that pop into my head when we're talking about something competely different. I crave to learn all that I can, so I sometimes check out completely random books or keep clicking on highlighted words in wikipedia until I'm from fast food to knee surgery LOL. 

 People tell me I have a sharp eye, a way with words, nice pitch concerning singing, a nice voice, a very imaginative mind, outspoken, funny, awesome, etc. 

 But I'm modest. Of course people don't understand that there are so many people out there that are better at what I do than me currently. And I strive to achieve their status so that I can feel comfortable with myself. I do not like public displays of affection; it seems...crude, cheesy, innapropriate in a way. I also don't like getting too close to people, for I know that many people change their minds and attitudes so quickly that I won't be able to keep up with the times, their current likes, their current dislikes; why don't people just stick to something and follow through? I mean, stop hating and dating her, stop cussing him out and then holding hands with him the next minute. It confuses me.
